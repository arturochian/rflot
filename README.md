### flot for R

The flot package is an R interface to the [Flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/) JavaScript charting library. It is a *thin* wrapper, giving the [R] user unfettered access to the parameters of the JS library.  It boasts the ability to display point, line, and bar charts and features:

- Configurable interactive features including ...
- Configurable axes and legends ...
- Ability to zoom in/out ...
- Ability to display grouped data ...
- Ability to easily produce plots in RStudio, RMarkdown or Shiny ...


#### Credits

- Much of the credit goes to the community developing the [Flot JS charting library](https://github.com/flot/flot).
- The ease with which I ported the flot JS library to [R] would not possible without the [htmlwidghets](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets) package developed by Ramnath Vaidyanathan, in addition to members of the [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) team.
- This library is inspired by the [dygraphs](http://github.com/rstudio/dygraphs) package for plotting time-series under development by JJ Alaire.  In many ways I have structured the syntax in this package in a similar fashion, and I have borrowed some of the plumbing verbatim from there (see for example, R/utils.R:mergeLists)
