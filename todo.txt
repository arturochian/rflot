- Per group options (color) customization
  Currently grouped data series are specified with a single call to flotSeries.
  The arguments therein are inheritted by all series defined by the grouping.
  Would be nice to be able to differentiate these per groupping.
- Rename 'names' to some sort of named argument
  Really, first of all 'names' is a bad variable names ('axesVars'?).
- Manual color/fill scaling
- Automatic time-series conversion
  Having to convert to UTC*1000 is really sad - let's do this automatically upon
  detecting a date/time object.
- Sensible defaults
  How about default xaxis, yaxis labels? Or maybe point instead of line as
  default.  For bars, how about width=.9, and automatic allign center.
- Clean up
